What is Science?</p>\n                <p>\n                    This is one stream that most of you would have a fair bit of idea about. Not just because everyone studies science\n                    subjects till class 10th at least, but also because this is a stream people can’t seem to stop talking about.\n\n                    <br /><br/><b> From statements like, “Go for the science stream so that you can become an Engineer or a Doctor” to even\n                    “You are good at academics, you would be thinking of opting science, I’m sure?”</b>\n\n                    <br /><b> Those of you who are preparing for the 10th standard board exams are most likely surrounded by questions like which stream to choose?</b>\n                    <br /><b> Whether to take a road less travelled or study subjects opted by many?</b>\n                    <br /><b> And what are the career prospects in different fields?</b>\n                    <br /><br/> Self-introspection is the key to unlock the box of your queries!  As you are aware, you can opt for \n                    either Science, Commerce or Arts stream after 10th standard. Before choosing a stream, you should conduct an in-depth \n                    analysis of your strengths and weaknesses and then select a stream that aligns with your interests and professional goals.\n                    While the Commerce and Arts stream subjects have their own advantages, methodologies, and career prospects, we, in this blog,\n                    will shed light on various Science stream subjects. But before that, let us try to understand the reasons for choosing this \n                    stream. \n\n                    While these notions hardly hold a candle to reality, chances are you would have some type of understanding about what the science\n                    stream entails.\n\n                    The Science stream, as I mentioned above, relates to the study of the physical and natural world through the study\n                    of pure sciences and their applications in the real world. From understanding how the laws of gravitation govern\n                    planetary motion to learning about the structure of the atom, you will uncover the many mysteries of the world around\n                    us.\n\n                    Thus, innate curiosity and keenness to explore, coupled with a logical thinking ability are essential to be successful\n                    in this stream.\n                </p>\n\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading\">2. Science Stream Subjects after Class 10th :</p> \n                <p>The science stream is further divided into 2 branches, namely medical (PCB) and non-medical (PCM) science stream.\n                <br /> \n                The difference between the two lies in the choice of the third subject. While Physics and Chemistry are compulsory for both, the medical stream offers Biology as the 3rd compulsory subject, and the non-medical stream offers Mathematics. English is common to all streams and students can take up any optional subject to meet a total of 5 subjects.\n\n                Here is a detailed look into the compulsory subjects in the Science stream:\n                </p>   \n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading_1\">\n                    I.

Advances in the field of physics enable advancements in\n                    technologies, such as the study of electromagnetism, thermodynamics, mechanics, nuclear physics and solid-state physics.\n\n                    Studying physics at Class 11-12 level will help you develop observational, analytical, investigatory and decision\n                    making skills, along with conceptual understanding, creative thinking, and problem-solving skills.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Examples of a few topics you will study are:\n                    <br />\n                    <br />• Kinematics\n                    <br />• Laws of Motion\n                    <br />• Thermodynamics\n                    <br />• Electrostatics\n                    <br />• Electromagnetic Waves\n                    <br />• Electronic Devices\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    After studying physics there are a variety of career options available, including working as a physicist, astronaut,\n                    data scientist, technician, and engineer.\n                </p>\n\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading_1\">\n                    II.

The most popular ones being,\n                    “Commerce is good for average students who cannot get into science” or “Commerce is only suitable for students from\n                    business families.”\n\n                    These are again a far cry from the truth. Commerce is a field that relates to the study of business, trade and finance.\n                    Commerce students study how goods and services are exchanged, how businesses operate, how financial transactions occur,\n                    how the economy of the country works, and more. The indispensability of commerce and its related careers to our day-to-day\n                    living makes it a lucrative field to explore, and one with a wide choice of career options too.\n\n                    While you may or may not choose to study Mathematics as part of Commerce, numbers form the base for this stream.\n                    A strong hold over calculations and fundamentals of maths, and the ability to deal with large amounts of data are\n                    critical elements of success in the commerce stream. \n                </p>\n            </div>        \n\n            <div className=\"school_container2_3\">\n                <section id=\"school_container2_heading3\">\n                    Arts/Humanities\n                </section>\n                <p>\n                   Arts is also known as “Humanities”.\n\n                   Humanities as a domain have been widely misunderstood and disregarded in the past, but as we complete the second decade\n                   of the 21st century, things are changing fast. Not considered as a stream for academically weak students anymore, more\n                   and more students are looking to opt humanities for the wide range of subject and career options it provides.\n\n                   Humanities is a very broad domain that covers areas related to the human society, relationships, culture and systems.\n                   These fields help you gain a deeper understanding of how the world and society around us work and how human society,\n                   laws and norms have evolved over time. From the study of how people interact in group settings to the study of the legal rights of \n                   citizens, everything comes under the purview of humanities.\n\n                   Students who are aware and curious to learn about world affairs, social issues, historical events and society are \n                   the ideal fit to explore humanities as their stream in class 11th and 12th.\n\n                   Arts provides various career opportunities. These include those of a painter, designer, an archaeologist,\n                   an animation artist. It also opens up jobs like those of a psychologist, journalist, media and film person.\n                   It also opens fields like those of Hotel Management, tourism industry, fashion blogger, event management.\n                   People can also become a lawyer, sociologist, anthropologist, a judge, language expert, a teacher.\n                   They can also become a counsellor, content writer and historian.\n                </p>\n            </div>                     \n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <Footer />\n        </StyledApp>\n        </ThemeProvider>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default School\n\n\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
